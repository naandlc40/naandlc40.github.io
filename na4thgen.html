family managed to save it. I received it from uncle Roly. Thanks to him we have
this picture. Weird when you think it is now 140 years old.<br>
I have seen his name reported as Naber for
some reason but the church registries I have accessed say Nabor.<br>
The story I was told is that he went to the
Kamouraska region for a period of time. Not surprising as his mom's family was
from there but he apparently moved back to the St Godefroi - Paspébiac area.
Records do indicate that several of his children were born there.</b></font></p>
