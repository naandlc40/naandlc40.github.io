				<strong><span class="style3">from uncle Rolly</span></strong></P>
              <P>J<font size="2"><b>oseph Anglehart: married Marie Annelkawine Place and date 
              unknown. (Her name sounds to be of Canadian Indian origin.)<br>
              Marriage certificate states that he was German and the name was 
              written Migkelharte. It was said that two brothers came across, 
              one in Canada and one in the United States. There are some 
              prominent Engelhardt in the USA One at the museum in Buffalo.<br>
              I, Rolly, question the above names or spelling! I have a copy 
              of the 1871 census of Bonaventure, Sub district of New Richmond. 
              71 names that read the Anglehardt, Angleheart, Engleheart. It was 
              common to write names in different spellings. The same for the 
              Irish name, Casey, written Quessey, Caissie.<br>
              The purpose of this section is only meant to trace our name 
              Anglehart to Engelhardt and not Migkelharte or Mikel Horth.<br>
              January 11th, 1997, I had a meeting with a German 
              Industrialist, a Doctor in Economics who retired here and was 
              involved in Schulteiss brewery in Berlin, who purchased Engelhardt 
              brewery in 1970&#8217;s. It does not operate anymore. He knew all the 
              principle owners. In 1920, it was owned by a Jewish group. Later 
              sold to Schulteiss Brewery, which is now owned by a conglomerate 
              of companies.<br>
              He says that Annelkawine, Migkelharte and Mikel Horth are not 
              German names.<br>
              My grandfather, Eugene, and many other relatives claim that our 
              ancestors did own the Engelhardt Brauerei, in Charlottenberg 
              district in Berlin Germany, and that they also owned a chateau in 
              Alsace- Loraine, now in France, where 80% of the population are 
              Germans. In 1913, I was told by my father and my uncle that a 
              woman came from Germany to St. Godefroi. PQ to have the family 
              sign off the Berlin property for a financial settlement. 
              Supposedly, some relatives were very excited about it. Then the 
              war broke out shortly after, and no one heard anymore. 
              Subsequently John-Hall Kelly, ( a prominent Quebec lawyer ) who 
              was Eugene ( my grandfather ) Anglehart&#8217;s cousin, was to look into 
              the affairs while he was a Canadian Ambassador in Ireland, but 
              died at an early age. In 1974, I, Rolly, and my wife Helen, were 
              given a tour of the brewery, in Charlottenberg area of Berlin, and 
              brought back many souvenirs.</b></font> </P>
            <P align=right><font size="2"><b>Rolly Anglehart</b></font></P>
      <p>From additional research though I found the our ancestor Joseph 
		Anglehart may have spelled the name differently and most likely 
		Englehardt or Anglehardt. <br>
		His wife though was Marie Annel Kawine.<p>This family was from the 
				Alsace Lorraine area and they spoke German and French. So 
				settling in the Gaspe area was a logical choice. They were 
				allotted a homestead which it appears some of the family is 
				still on. All they had to do then was to clear so much land 
				every year for so many years and that land was yours to keep.<p>
				Both father and son had previous military experience as well. At 
				that time Canada was encouraging such people to settle here that 
				had military experience which could be useful if a war with the 
				US did happen as it was anticipated. It actually did happen in 
				1812 but that was too late to affect them.</td>
